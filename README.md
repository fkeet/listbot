A Python IRC bot intended for list serv channels. It monitors the list of
channels for list adverts, and collects the lists.

This is intended for gathering lists, and eventually queueing items from the
lists

Currently only gathers lists.

Next steps:
* unpack lists
* provide a 'search' function for admin users
* provide a 'queue' function for admin users
* find and trigger items from the queue list
